                            <p>And it starts with our ingredients.</p>
                            <p>Is it just us, or are a lot of restaurants using words that don’t really mean anything? They talk about their “artisanal” chefs and “superfoods,” and how their “all-natural” menus are perfect for “eating clean.” Wait, what?</p>
                            <p>At Food Feat, we understand how powerful words can be. We were founded on the words, "Quality is our Recipe.” And since day one in 1969, we have worked hard to meet that standard each and every day. But we believe that there’s a difference between talking the talk and walking the walk. Without specifics, “quality” is just another word that sounds good, but has no real meat on it. And you know we’re not about that.</p>
                            <p>So, we decided to write those specifics down for everyone to see. They are the four foundational “ingredients” that guide our food choices and make up the recipe book from which our employees, restaurant operators and suppliers all work. At Wendy’s, “quality” is more than just a word we use; it’s a value we live by. It’s a commitment to ourselves, to every member of our fresh food supply chain, and to you to do things differently — to do them better than the other guys.</p>

                                Wendy’s is a leader in the development and execution of quality processes and initiatives that are focused intensely on providing a safe and wholesome food supply – from our suppliers’ farms to the customer's table.
                                <br><br>
                                The quality, performance and innovation of our suppliers have a direct impact on Wendy’s success. To maintain strong supplier relationships, Wendy’s and its franchisees are members of Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. SM . This independent cooperative works with leading suppliers to provide Wendy’s restaurants with products and services that offer quality, consistency and value.
                                <br><br>
                                We take a leadership role in influencing positive behaviors from our suppliers. Among the initiatives we have with our suppliers are Quality Assurance visits to their plants to ensure the highest product quality and integrity. Suppliers undergo regular audits by both trained Wendy's Quality Assurance representatives and third-party experts.
                                <br><br>
                                In addition, we work with multiple trade associations and partners to support industry-wide efforts to advance food quality and safety standards.

                                <p>Since we opened the first Wendy’s in 1969, we have been proud to source most of our food from American farmers and ranchers. It’s a partnership built on mutual respect with an unwavering commitment to quality. This is important, because “Quality is our Recipe.®”
                                    <br><br>
                                    Farming and running restaurants are both hard work. Our restaurants are successful because of our managers and crew members as well as workers on the farm, in the field and everywhere in between. Our goal is to provide our customers with quality and wholesome food, good value and “A Cut Above” experience every visit. With the support of our suppliers, we work to deliver that every day.
                                </p>

                                <p>At Wendy’s, we take our role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously, which includes the humane treatment of animals.
                                    <br><br>
                                Wendy’s does not own, raise, transport or process livestock. However, we believe it is our obligation to ensure that all of our suppliers exceed government regulations by meeting Wendy’s more exacting standards pertaining to the humane treatment of animals.

                                <p>Since our founding by Dave Thomas in 1969, we have always been committed to operating under a core set of values which begin and end with Quality. These values extend to the long-standing, collaborative relationships we have with our trusted suppliers. Our Supplier Code of Conduct embraces the best practices of our supply chain and outlines the specific expectations and requirements we have of this community. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The Code is centered around five areas that are important to our brand, our customers and our supply chain, including: Food Safety and Food Ingredients, Farm Animal Health and Well-Being, Human Rights and Labor Practices, Environmentally Sustainable Business Practices, and Business Ethics and Integrity. The Code goes above and beyond the requirements laid out in The Wendy’s Company and Quality Supply Chain Cooperative’s (QSCC) Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics.
                                    <br><br>
                                    All covered suppliers are expected to annually affirm they have received and understand the specific requirements of the Code.
